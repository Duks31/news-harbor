This is how the project workflow is: ![workflow](./assets/workflow.png)

## Usage
### How it works
- The user enters the news_article API_key; in this case i used my api key in the `.env` file in secrets folder which was loaded to the `news_api_data.py` file.

- The API is then used to fetch the news article from the news api, which returns a JSON. chcek the `news_api_data.py` file and the `news_api_data.json` file in core folder and data folder respectively.

- The JSON is then converted to a pandas dataframe and then the dataframe is sent to the sentiment analysis model. check the `convert.py` file in core folder. 

- The sentiment analysis model returns the sentiment of the news article in a CSV file format. check the `model.ipynb` file in model folder. Note: Google Colab was used in running the sentiment analysis model.

- The sentiment in CSV is sent to the frontend.

- The frontend displays the sentiment of the news article. check the `main.py` file in the frontend folder.
